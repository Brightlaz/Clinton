      <h1>Research</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="d-details">
      <p class="Res-info">At this phase, we had limited information about the problem we were trying to solve. Everything we had imagine exists, 
        but it is only an assumption. We needed to validate these assumptions, so we conducted a qualitative interview
         to gain a deep understanding of our users' frustrations, motivations and to better understand the actual problem.
      </p>
      <p class="Res-info">I interviewed eligible citizens of Nigeria to understand how they go about with the current voting process. 
        The research focuses on understanding their behaviors, needs, and motivations through structured observation. 
      </p>
      <h2>Our Assumptions</h2>
      <section>
        <p>People don’t go out on election day to cast votes because they feel a surge of election violence during the process.</p>
        <p>On some occasions, there are delays in opening polling units and malfunctioning systems that interrupt voting.</p>
        <p>Most people do not exercise their civil right to vote because they feel their vote does not count.</p>
        <p>Pre-election violence tends to be more localized, it involves conflict between supporters of competing political parties.</p>
        <p>Some individuals do not even have a voter’s card because the voter registration process is too tedious, frustrating, and time-consuming.</p>
        <p>Some people find it difficult to travel back to their registered polling unit before and during the election to cast their votes.</p>
      </section>
      <div class="Res-info">
        <h2>User Interviews</h2>
        <p>Considering the variation of our users, I interviewed 3 category of people that were a reflection of our target audience, 
          3 each of adults, young adults, and people living with disability who can or may have exercised their civil right to vote 
          through structured observation. The interview questions were developed to gain a deep understanding of users’ challenges and 
          motivations.

      <section>
        <p>What I witnessed from this past election in my polling unit is something I don’t wish for anyone. My God, if you see the way the election ground was turned into war scene for some reason I don’t know, fight from no where, boys rooted out bottles and chased us all, they didn’t even consider the cripple man that came out to vote, he was just there helpless. I ran with my heart in my hand, it felt like it was my day to leave this earth. </p>
        <p>I mean like ways of voting, ways of registration, telling people about there right of voting, just make people understand how voting is good and the reason why they should vote. It will be much better if they understand because most people don’t understand, they feel they are voting because they are offered money or offered promises.</p>
        <p>I don’t know much oh, it’s stressful sha, if it was more online i don’t know if it’s possible but if it was more online it would have been more better and more easy because people can be at there ease voting not to come and stand at a long queue to vote, you understand? The voting in Nigeria is stressful sha, and not secured too because sometimes problem might break out, you can never tell.</p>
        <p>The boys attacked us while we were voting, they were armed with machetes, broken bottles, and other weapons. The police were unarmed, why won’t they run? How on earth will you be securing a unit from violence and you are not armed.</p>
        <p>My own opinion, I would like it for our government to look for a way to leave the analog way of voting and embrace digital way of voting, that’s all i can say at least that will be far more better. From corruption, they won’t be able to manipulate my vote, and the vote of many other citizens.</p>
        <p>The stories we normally hear is that, there are manipulations, the settings has been there in previous elections, if the evidence is there, they should look into another system.</p>
        <p>The boys came and  told everyone that if you want to vote for APC, go home. They later came back and destroyed everything, and chased us out from the voting ground.</p>
        <p>Most times the challenges I face is the delay of delivery of voting material, they don’t come on time, the inec officers they don’t come on time to the unit, the wards.</p>

        <h2>Setting Up Connections with Affinity Mapping</h2>
        <p>After collecting feedback from people, I added each observation from our interview to a sticky note. Next, I organized the sticky notes together into themes and patterns. And finally, we gave each of those themes a name to represent what that theme means.</p>
