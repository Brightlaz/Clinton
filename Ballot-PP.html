          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            The 1999 transition of Nigeria from military to civilian
            (democratic) government, is a defining moment in Nigerian history,
            representing the beginning of the longest, uninterrupted Government
            since independence in 1960, 6 democratic election has been conducted
            ever since.
          </p>

          <h2><br /></h2>
          <p>
            Nigeria has a population of 200million and over 84million registered
            voters as of March 11, 2019 ( Nigeria's last general election), and
            only 49.78% cast their votes.

            Ballot is an online voting platform that enables eligible Nigerian
            citizens to cast vote for their respective choice canditates faster
            and easier by scanning their voter’s card issued by INEC to get fast
            access to vote. Ballot also helps citizens to lookup of results of
            ongoing and past election from the comfort of their homes.

      <h1>Research</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="d-details">
      <p class="Res-info">At this phase, we had limited information about the problem we were trying to solve. Everything we had imagine exists, 
        but it is only an assumption. We needed to validate these assumptions, so we conducted a qualitative interview
         to gain a deep understanding of our users' frustrations, motivations and to better understand the actual problem.
      </p>
      <p class="Res-info">I interviewed eligible citizens of Nigeria to understand how they go about with the current voting process. 
        The research focuses on understanding their behaviors, needs, and motivations through structured observation. 
      </p>
      <h2>Our Assumptions</h2>
      <section>
        <p>People don’t go out on election day to cast votes because they feel a surge of election violence during the process.</p>
        <p>On some occasions, there are delays in opening polling units and malfunctioning systems that interrupt voting.</p>
        <p>Most people do not exercise their civil right to vote because they feel their vote does not count.</p>
        <p>Pre-election violence tends to be more localized, it involves conflict between supporters of competing political parties.</p>
        <p>Some individuals do not even have a voter’s card because the voter registration process is too tedious, frustrating, and time-consuming.</p>
        <p>Some people find it difficult to travel back to their registered polling unit before and during the election to cast their votes.</p>
      </section>
      <div class="Res-info">
        <h2>User Interviews</h2>
        <p>Considering the variation of our users, I interviewed 3 category of people that were a reflection of our target audience, 
          3 each of adults, young adults, and people living with disability who can or may have exercised their civil right to vote 
          through structured observation. The interview questions were developed to gain a deep understanding of users’ challenges and 
          motivations. 
        </p>
        <p style="color: #454545
        ;font-weight: 700;">Sample Interview Questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Could you tell me a bit about yourself?</li>
          <li>What does your typical day look like?</li>
          <li>What are your best 3 apps on your phone?</li>
          <li>Why do you like them?</li>
          <li>What do you do on election day?</li>

      <h2 style="color: #07432A;">Interview Feedback</h2>
      <section>
        <p>What I witnessed from this past election in my polling unit is something I don’t wish for anyone. My God, if you see the way the election ground was turned into war scene for some reason I don’t know, fight from no where, boys rooted out bottles and chased us all, they didn’t even consider the cripple man that came out to vote, he was just there helpless. I ran with my heart in my hand, it felt like it was my day to leave this earth. </p>
        <p>I mean like ways of voting, ways of registration, telling people about there right of voting, just make people understand how voting is good and the reason why they should vote. It will be much better if they understand because most people don’t understand, they feel they are voting because they are offered money or offered promises.</p>
        <p>I don’t know much oh, it’s stressful sha, if it was more online i don’t know if it’s possible but if it was more online it would have been more better and more easy because people can be at there ease voting not to come and stand at a long queue to vote, you understand? The voting in Nigeria is stressful sha, and not secured too because sometimes problem might break out, you can never tell.</p>
        <p>The boys attacked us while we were voting, they were armed with machetes, broken bottles, and other weapons. The police were unarmed, why won’t they run? How on earth will you be securing a unit from violence and you are not armed.</p>
        <p>My own opinion, I would like it for our government to look for a way to leave the analog way of voting and embrace digital way of voting, that’s all i can say at least that will be far more better. From corruption, they won’t be able to manipulate my vote, and the vote of many other citizens.</p>
        <p>The stories we normally hear is that, there are manipulations, the settings has been there in previous elections, if the evidence is there, they should look into another system.</p>
        <p>The boys came and  told everyone that if you want to vote for APC, go home. They later came back and destroyed everything, and chased us out from the voting ground.</p>
        <p>Most times the challenges I face is the delay of delivery of voting material, they don’t come on time, the inec officers they don’t come on time to the unit, the wards.</p>

        <h2>Setting Up Connections with Affinity Mapping</h2>
        <p>After collecting feedback from people, I added each observation from our interview to a sticky note. Next, I organized the sticky notes together into themes and patterns. And finally, we gave each of those themes a name to represent what that theme means.</p>

      <div class="Res-info" style="margin-bottom: 61px;">
        <h2>Pulling Out Findings from each Theme</h2>
        <p>We work through each theme to pull out findings that can potentially be turned into insights. We started with those we consider to be a high priority on our research objectives.</p>
        <div class="sub-text">
          <p>Due to insecurity, ballot boxes are easily hijacked by thugs during the election.</p>
          <p>Some people believe election results are easily manipulated during the counting procedure.</p>
          <p>Elections are usually postponed due to violence, delays in opening poll centers, and malfunctioning card readers.</p>
          <p>Most people do not cast their votes during the election because of the uncertainty of the result and accompanying violence.</p>
          <p>Most people do not go out on election day to vote because they feel the candidate occupying the seat will eventually emerge as the winner.</p>
          <p>Delay in the arrival of electoral materials results in a late start of the election.</p>
          <p>Some people do not know the importance of exercising their civil rights.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Analyzing Themes and Findings to Gain Insights</h2>
        <p>As we synthesized each theme and its subsequent findings, we came up with some insights.</p>
        <div class="sub-text">
          <p>Some people sell their vote due to hardship for immediate satisfaction, not minding the long-term effect of their decision.</p>
          <p>Most geopolitical zones have designated party during the election that influences the choice of the people living there. People are forced with all measures (like bribery and violence) to abide by the zonal choice.</p>
          <p>Some people do not know the reasons why they should vote. They vote because money and promises are the rewards for exercising their civil right.</p>
          <p>Some people do not care about the consequences of when the wrong candidate emerges as the winner but rather focus on the money to be given to them, thereby storming polling units, destroying electoral materials, and chasing away voters and officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission.</p>
          <h3>Key Insight</h3>
          <p>The current voting process does not accommodate physically challenged citizens. The process has structured a belief among people that physically challenged citizens are expected not to participate in the election or exercise their civil rights.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Sticking with Inclusiveness on the Process</h2>
        <p>The key insight we uncovered through user research and subsequent analysis, “The current voting process does not accommodate physically challenged citizens. The process has structured a belief among people that physically challenged citizens are expected not to participate in the election or exercise their civil rights,” guided our next step in the design process. We needed to focus on learning about this underrepresented group, so we conducted a qualitative interview to gain more understanding of their frustrations, behaviors, needs, and motivations.</p>
        <p>After collecting the second round of feedback from people, we followed our initial steps of adding each observation from our interview to a sticky note. Next, we organized the sticky notes together into themes and patterns. And finally, we gave each of those themes a name to represent what that theme means.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-text2">Some Findings from the Focused Research</h2>
        <p>As we have done earlier, we work through each theme to gather findings from the synthesized feedback from the focus group.</p>
        <div class="sub-text">
          <p>Elections in Nigeria, if not always, accompanied by violence, physically challenged citizens are more vulnerable to harm.</p>
          <p>Most physically challenged citizens would prefer a house-to-house voting system.</p>
          <p>Delay in the arrival of electoral materials results in a late start of the election, which poses more stress to physically challenged citizens during the election.</p>
          <p>The current voting system is not inclusive of physically challenged citizens.</p>
          <p>The physically challenged citizens feel less represented by the Government due to their constant complaints about creating a space for them.</p>
          <p>Some physically challenged citizens prefer the current voting process because they get to go out and see other people casting their votes.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0;">Key Insights</h2>
        <div class="sub-text" style="margin-left: 0;">
          <p>Society thinks physically challenged people are uneducated and have no meaning in living. It causes them to lose interest in the political affairs of the country.</p>
          <p>Election-related violence, tedious voters’ registration process, and social discrimination have caused a low turn up of physically challenged citizens to exercise their civil rights. </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Visualizing User Attitudes and Behaviors Through Empathy Mapping</h2>
        <p>I needed to establish a common ground among my team members for us to have a single, shared understanding of the user, and to better understand and prioritize user needs. What drives users’ behaviors? was an important question to understand in order to uncover user needs. By visually articulating what we know about our users through research helped in decision making. </p>
      </div>
      <img src="assets/imgs/persona.svg" alt="">
      <div class="Res-info sub-text2" style="margin-bottom: 60px;">
        <h2>Describing Typical User Through a  Persona</h2>
        <p>The target user persona was defined properly from the user research, affinity and empathy mapping. The personas helped promote empathy, memorability of target users, prioritize features, and inform design decisions.</p>

      <div class="Res-info sub-text2"  style="margin-bottom: 60px;">
        <h2>Mapping the User Journeys</h2>
        <p>As a team, we collaboratively created user journey maps for citizens eligible to vote and the underrepresented group in order to further understand their goals, frustrations, and motivations by visualizing the process it takes them to cast a vote.  </p>

          <h3>Crafting Point of View - Problem Statements</h3>
          <p>After a proper user definition, highlighting their needs, and the insights we have come to know through our research, we came up with some actionable problem statements.</p>
          <p class="imp">Problem Statements:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Mark is a Mechanical student who needs an easy way to cast a vote for his choice candidate because the current voting process is stressful and time-consuming.</li>
            <li>Folake is a hair stylist who needs to exercise her civil rights because of the monetary reward she will get from bribery without considering the long-term effect of her decision.</li>
            <li>Jude is an unemployed citizen who needs to storm and destroy electoral materials in the coming election because of the monetary reward he will get from bribery due to hardship.</li>
            <li>Yusuf is a Civil servant who needs a welcoming platform to participate in the political affairs of his country because he feels exempt from society.</li>
            <li>Ada is a Fashion designer who needs to vote from the diaspora because she cannot travel back home to exercise her civil right due to the cost of transportation.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-text2">
          <h3>Generating “How Might We” Questions</h3>
          <p>At this point, we started using our point-of-view problem statements by asking specific questions with “How Might We” to generate ideas for the coming phase.</p>
          <p class="imp">Some How Might We Questions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How might we ensure elections are not postponed due to violence, delays in opening poll centers, and malfunctioning card readers?</li>
            <li>How might we ensure safety of people and electoral materials during election?</li>
            <li>How might we make it easy for physically challenged citizens to cast their vote</li>
            <li>How might we eradicate the hijacking of ballot boxes during election? </li>
            <li>How might we make politicians to be accountable to citizens?</li>
            <li>How might we educate people on the importance of exercising their civil rights?</li>
            <li>How might we make electoral process fast and easy for citizens to cast their vote</li>
            <li>How might we educate people about the consequences of selling their vote?</li>
            <li>How might we make people believe their vote counts?</li>

            <h3>Generating Broad Set of Ideas</h3>
            <p>We timed ourselves and came up with ideas that focused on the point-of-view problem statements. We stayed on the topic, deferred criticism, and aimed for quantity. We encouraged weird and wild ideas and built on each other’s ideas.</p>
            <p>Using the <span class="imp">Post-It-Voting</span> ideation method to select ideas, we collected the best solutions by categorizing, refining, and narrowing down the ideas.</p>
            <p class="imp">Some Possible Solutions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Create a platform where users can look up voting information before the election.</li>
              <li>Create a product that can remind users of an upcoming election.</li>
              <li>Create easy-to-use platform users can cast votes from anywhere they are and verify they are eligibility to vote.</li>
              <li>Mounting security cameras in polling units will enable citizens to watch the ongoing election from anywhere and reduce election-related violence.</li>
              <li>Build a credible platform where users can look up ongoing election results.</li>
              <li>Create a platform that will educate citizens about elections, how to register for their voters’ cards, their rights to vote, and how to vote in every indigenous language.</li>
              <li>Create a platform that will educate citizens about elections, how to register for their voters’ cards, their rights to vote, and how to vote.</li>

        <h3>Rough Sketches</h3>
        <p>Starting out my visual design process, I write a list of the information that needs to go on a page, and quickly bring out my ideas through sketching which is faster and easier. The goal here for me was to get all my ideas out, so I stayed focused on quantity rather than quality. With the aid of my problem statements, I was able to sketch out my ideas rapidly and settled in for the ones I want to explore further in a digital wireframe.</p>

          <h3>Mid-Fi Wireframes</h3>
          <p>Mid-fidelity wireframes were created with enough detail so that users can understand the basic features and navigation during usability testing.</p>

        <h3>User Testing</h3>
        <p>The mid-fidelity wireframes with limited functionality and aesthetics were tested by 12 users (6 Disability users, 3 Adults, and 1 Young adult) through a moderated usability testing. We wanted to test the effectiveness of the layout and navigation, onboarding flow, landing page structure, vote casting flow, election stats flow, and election calendar flow.</p>

        <h3>Changes Made</h3>
        <section>
          <p>A “Skip” button was added to the signup process so users can check election calendars and results without having to signup first.</p>
          <p>“Assist button” was added across all screens for users to use voice command to navigate through the platform, and a chatbot to converse and carryout specific tasks.</p>
          <p>“Winner of election” was added to the top of election statistics.</p>

        <h3>UI Design</h3>
        <p>After testing our early concepts with real users, I implemented the findings from the usability studies and then came up with more realistic designs that match the final designs in terms of details and functionality. I went on to design high fidelity screens for desktop and mobile.</p>
        <div class="sub-text2">
          <h3>Onboarding Screens</h3>
          <p>We wanted to educate users about elections and what it entails briefly and concisely through our onboarding screens. It’s a way for us to create awareness of the importance of exercising civil rights.</p>

        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>Considering our first persona that represents users with a disability, we added some features that will make our product inclusive to our users.</p>

        <h3>Digital Voters’ Card</h3>
        <p>The platform is able to create a digital voter’s card by collecting citizens’ VIN. The platform can scan voters’ card barcodes to generate voter information in case the VIN on the card is faded.</p>

        <h3>Verification</h3>
        <p>Security is a priority in our platform, we aimed for “One man One Vote” so we implemented extra verification steps. An OTP will be sent to the mobile number used during the voters’ registration. In cases when the user is no longer using the same phone number, we implemented facial recognition to capture the user’s photo and match it with the one on the voter’s card. </p>

        <h3>Learnings & Next Steps</h3>
        <p>Designing experiences for a diverse group of people can be quite a challenge. Articulating research feedback from different demography was overwhelming, the process became a bit easy after I had focused on the less represented group through the help of inclusive design approach, “design for one, design for all.” Considering the people living with a disability more was the game changer, empathizing and crafting solutions for these set of users paved way for inclusiveness in Ballot. </p>
        <p>The Ballot platform is currently under development and I would be conducting future reviews with the team to ensure more security enhancement.</p>
