      <p>APARTMENT RENTAL UX CASE STUDY</p>
      <h1>A quick and reliable way of renting an apartment</h1>
      <div class="P-info">
        <div>
          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            Due to Nigeria's substandard mortgage system, an increasing number
            of people are renting apartments. For one reason or another, people
            are constantly looking for new flats. These reasons can include
            family growth, relocation, school, vacation, etc. However, looking
            for an apartment can be a stressful and time-consuming procedure
            that drains people's time, resources, and energy.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="two">
          <h2>My Role</h2>
          <p>
            I led user research, competitor research, wireframing, user testing,

        <div>
          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            To aid in the search for a suitable apartment and expedite the
            procedure, people hire middlemen (agents). With this strategy, an
            agency fee is required. When an agent accepts many jobs, they fully
            anticipate not meeting each deadline. Prevarication results from it,
            which may have an impact on later goals and plans of the tenants.

        <h2>User Interview</h2>
        <p>
          In order to understand the traditional way of renting an apartment, I
          interviewed 3 property owners, 5 tenants, and 3 agents that were a
          reflection of the target audience.

            ><br />
            Many of them mentioned that they pay in the range of one to four
            thousand naira daily to agents during the hunt for an apartment, and
            there is a compulsory agent fee to be paid when the flat is
            acquired.

              months</b
            ><br />
            The delay in acquiring a suitable apartment is caused by different
            factors. Participant one says that the first thing they consider is
            an environment with security that is not affected by a flood. People
            move into an environment without an idea of the environmental
            condition in which they are forced to live with those conditions
            since apartment owners rarely refund rent.

          <p>
            <b>Of respondents prefer hunting for apartments themselves</b><br />
            Most people use an agent for apartment hunting due to their busy
            schedules and unfamiliarity with other territories. They usually end
            up in an environment they’re not comfortable with since agents don’t
            usually pay attention to their preferences.

        <h2>Competitor Research</h2>
        <p>
          I researched 4 of Surent's top competitors in the industry. I assessed
          how the product offerings of these competitors are translated to
          platform features and studied the apartment rental industry to gain
          insights into its services, sales, and marketing strategies. I used
          the information from the analysis as a point of comparison to identify
          Surent's strengths and weaknesses relative to each competitor. I
          analyzed the competing companies based on their business model,
          product offering, unique value proposition, website experience, and
          the number of areas covered.

          also established a shared understanding with stakeholders.

        <h3>Drawing out Concepts</h3>
        <p>
          Rough drawings are undoubtedly the most easy, iterative, and
          economical way to begin user interface design. I start by making a
          list of the information that needs to be on a page and then rapidly
          sketch down my thoughts since it is quicker and easier to do so. For
          me, the objective was to express all of my thoughts, thus I remained
          more concerned with quantity than quality. I was able to quickly draw
          out my ideas with the help of my issue statements, and I determined on
          the ones I want to investigate in more detail in a digital wireframe.

      </div>
      <div class="Res-info">
        <h3>Mid-Fi Wireframes</h3>
        <p>
          I created mid-fidelity wireframes that were as close to the final
          designs as I could get using the sketches as a base. I concentrated on
          interaction design when making the wireframes, making sure the user
          flow was clear and addressed user issues. It was important to me to
          design this in sufficient depth so that I could quickly test its basic
          functions and navigation with users.

        <h3>Usability Testing - Results and Refinements</h3>
        <p>
          Through a moderated usability testing, 10 users—5 renters, 4
          landlords, and 1 agent—tested the mid-fidelity wireframes with limited
          functionality and aesthetics. At this point, the test objectives were
          to evaluate the effectiveness of the layout and navigation of the
          landing page, the brand messaging, the onboarding process, the
          apartment search process, the account creation process, and the
          apartment upload process.

            in the same section of the page,
            <span style="font-weight: 600">75%</span> of testers were unable to

            into separate sections, allowing users to begin their individual
            journeys.

            It was necessary for users to rapidly bookmark an apartment they
            liked before continuing their search since they wanted to choose
            from a variety of options so I added a ‘save’ icon button to the
            apartment ads.

          I used Figma to produce high-fidelity mockups after making the
          necessary revisions in light of the user testing. I created designs
          for both desktop and mobile platforms, paying special attention to the
          mobile experience, since more users would access the website using
          their mobile phones. The overall design was clean, modern, and
          uncomplicated. In an effort to improve accessibility, convey states,
          and create visual contrast, typography, shapes, and colors were used.

        <h3>Learnings & Outcomes</h3>
        <p>
          To begin with, in terms of responsive design, creating a
          mobile-friendly website was crucial for meeting the needs of users who
          frequently access rental listings on the go. This included optimizing
          the website's layout and functionality for smaller screens, as well as
          making sure that all features were easily accessible and usable on
          mobile devices. The ability to vet landlords before listing their
          apartments was an important aspect of the user experience. This
          entailed implementing a landlord verification process, which helped to
          ensure that all listings were legitimate and trustworthy. User reviews
          were also added to the website to provide users with more information
          about the landlords and their properties.
          <br /><br />
          Finally, a key outcome of the project was the creation of an intuitive
          user experience. This involved simplifying the search process, making
          it easy for users to find relevant listings, and providing clear and
          concise information about each property. Furthermore, the process of
          submitting an application for an apartment has been streamlined,
          allowing users to complete the process in a short amount of time.
