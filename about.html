          <p>
            A driven and passionate product designer living in Port Harcourt,
            Nigeria. I bring a unique perspective to the design process, always
            putting the user experience first. I thrives in collaborative
            environments and I’m dedicated to problem solving through the use of
            technology. I’m an active listener and clear communicator. I spend
            my free time watching or playing football, reading, or learning and
            improving my skills. I am a proactive and quick learner who is
            always looking for new challenges and ways to innovate in my field.
            <br />
            <br />
            In 2011, I began learning graphic design and eventually moved on to
            computer programming, experimenting with languages such as Java,
            C++, and VB.Net. Ultimately, I decided to concentrate on frontend
            web development, and I honed my skills through self-study rather
            than traditional work experience. Despite my lack of traditional
            work experience, my interest in technology and dedication to
            self-learning have most likely resulted in a strong skill set and a
            desire to create innovative products. In order to create more
            informed solutions, I'm also expanding my skill set by learning data
            analysis. <br /><br />
            Having transitioned from frontend web development to product design.
            This allowed me to bring a unique perspective to my work, as I have
            a deep understanding of the technical capabilities and limitations
            of the web. I am able to design interfaces that not only look good,
            but are also functional and simple to use. I also has a keen eye for
            detail when it comes to user experience. I understand the importance
            of creating intuitive and seamless interfaces, and I’m able to
            anticipate and solve potential problems before they arise.
            <br /><br />
            Furthermore, my knowledge of web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript allows me to communicate effectively with developers and
            bridge the gap between design and development. This helps to ensure
            that my designs are not only beautiful, but also fully functional
            and optimized for performance. Overall, my transition from frontend
            web development has provided me with a unique set of skills and
            perspectives that greatly benefit my work in creating digital
            products.
